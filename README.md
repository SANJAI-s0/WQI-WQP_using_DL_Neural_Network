## 🔍 Project Overview
Access to clean water is a fundamental human necessity. However, water quality varies widely due to environmental, geographical, and human-induced factors. This project aims to accurately predict water quality metrics from chemical and physical parameters across various locations in India (2019-2022).

By leveraging Deep Learning, we provide two distinct predictive functionalities:
1. **Regression Analysis**: Predicting the numerical Water Quality Index (WQI).
2. **Multi-class Classification**: Categorizing samples into qualitative labels (e.g., Excellent, Good, Poor, Unsuitable).

---

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains chemical and physical samples collected from various wells across India.

### Features:
- **Geographical**: Well_ID, State, District, Block, Village, Latitude, Longitude.
- **Temporal**: Year (2019, 2020, 2021, 2022).
- **Indicators**: pH, Electrical Conductivity (EC), Carbonates (CO3), Bicarbonates (HCO3), Chlorides (Cl), Sulfates (SO4), Nitrates (NO3), Total Hardness (TH), Calcium (Ca), Magnesium (Mg), Sodium (Na), Potassium (K), Fluoride (F), Total Dissolved Solids (TDS).

### Targets:
- **WQI**: Continuous numerical value.
- **Water Quality Classification**: Categorical (Excellent, Good, Poor, Very Poor yet Drinkable, Unsuitable for Drinking).

## 🧠 Predictive Models
The project implements two separate Deep Neural Networks (DNN) using Keras/TensorFlow:

### 1. Regression Model (WQI)
- **Architecture**: Sequential API with multiple Dense layers (64 -> 32 -> 16 -> 1).
- **Optimizer**: Adam.
- **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE).

### 2. Classification Model (Category)
- **Architecture**: Sequential API (64 -> 32 -> 16 -> output_classes).
- **Activation**: ReLU for hidden layers, Softmax for the output layer.
- **Loss Function**: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy.

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
The models are evaluated based on the following:
- **Regression**: $R^2$ Score (Coefficient of Determination) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
- **Classification**: Accuracy Score and Weighted F1-Score.

---

## 🏆 Results
The models achieve reliable performance across the dataset. Detailed confusion matrices and loss curves can be found within the [Water_Quality_Prediction.ipynb](Water_Quality_Prediction.ipynb) notebook.
